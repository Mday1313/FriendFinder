# Welcome to Friend Finder <h1>

*Friend Finder is a basic full-stack compatibility app that uses Node, Express and Path.  The user will fill out the survey complete with their name and a photo.  For each question their answers will be compared to those of all users that came before.  The user with the closest compatibility will then be shown in a modal with their photo.  The current user will then be added to the array of users. 

*This app is deployed through Heroku [here](https://powerful-refuge-70262.herokuapp.com/).
